# Python Multi-Factor Authentication

Enhance the security of your user authentication with this simple Python script implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This MFA system combines a password with a time-based one-time code for added protection, using the PyOTP library.

## Features

- Two-step verification for user authentication.
- Random code generation for the time-based one-time code.
- Easy integration into existing user authentication systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install the required library:

   ```bash
   pip install pyotp
   ```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal in the directory where the script is located.

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python mfa_authenticator.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter your username, password, and the 6-digit Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) code.

4. The script will validate the provided information, and if successful, display "User Authentication Successful." Otherwise, it will show "User Authentication Failed."

## Customization

- Update the `users` dictionary in the script with your user information, including passwords and initial one-time codes.
- Modify the `generate_one_time_code()` function if you want to customize the way one-time codes are generated.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that user data, including passwords and one-time codes, is stored securely.
- Periodically update one-time codes for users to maintain security.
- Customize the script to meet your specific security requirements.
